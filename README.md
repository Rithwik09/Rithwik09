## 💡 About Me

I build high-performance, elegant websites with **Next.js** and backend powerhouses using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. I integrate **Passport.js** to secure everything like a knight in shining armor! 🛡️

When I'm not coding (which is rare 😏), you’ll probably find me leveling up my skills or plotting my next web domination scheme.

## 💼 My Superpowers Include:

- **Next.js** – Building web apps that load faster than a rocket leaving Earth’s atmosphere! 🚀
- **Node.js** – Handling backend services like a boss. If it's on the server, I’m the captain now. 🛠️
- **Passport.js** – No unauthorized access here! I gatekeep apps like a pro bouncer. 🕶️
- **Express.js** – Crafting APIs so smooth, you’ll think it’s made of butter. 🧈

## ⚡️ Fun Facts:

- I code faster than light travels. ⚡️ (Okay, maybe not *that* fast, but pretty close.)
- The command line fears me — I tame it with every keystroke. 👨‍💻
- My brain runs on caffeine and clean code. ☕️💻

---

## 🛠️ Tools of the Trade:

- **Visual Studio Code** – My IDE of choice. We’ve been through thick and thin.
- **Git** – I commit like my life depends on it (because it does).
- **Postman** – Testing APIs faster than you can say "GET request!"
- **Vercel/Heroku** – Deploying apps to the cloud like Zeus throwing thunderbolts. ⚡️
