# 🧁 Welcome to My Bakery of Code! 🍰

### Hi, I'm Rithwik — a master baker, but instead of dough, I work with code! 👨‍🍳✨

- 🔭 I’m a **Web Developer Extraordinaire** specializing in **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **Passport.js**, and **Express.js** — the finest ingredients for creating mouthwatering web experiences!
- 🌱 Currently learning to whip up even tastier websites with more powerful technologies.
- 🤔 Looking to collaborate? Let’s bake the internet a better place, one project at a time.
- 💬 Ask me anything about **Web Development** or how to build a site that's as irresistible as freshly baked cookies!

## 💡 About Me

I bake high-performance, elegant websites with **Next.js** and create backend goodness using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. I integrate **Passport.js** to make sure only those with the right "recipe" can access the goodies! 🍪

When I'm not coding (which is as rare as a cake without frosting), you'll probably find me leveling up my skills or whipping up my next digital masterpiece.

## 💼 My Baking Superpowers Include:

- **Next.js** – Baking websites that rise faster than a soufflé in a hot oven! 🍮
- **Node.js** – Handling backend processes like a seasoned baker rolling out dough. 🛠️
- **Passport.js** – No unauthorized "taste tests" here! I secure my apps like a pastry chef guards their secret recipes. 🕶️
- **Express.js** – Mixing APIs so smooth, it's like the perfect batter. 🧁

## ⚡️ Fun Facts:

- I code faster than cookies disappear at a bake sale. 🍪
- The command line? It’s my kitchen, and I rule it with a whisk (or a keyboard). 👨‍💻
- My brain runs on caffeine and freshly compiled code. ☕️💻

---

## 🛠️ Tools of the Trade:

- **Visual Studio Code** – My digital kitchen, where all the magic happens.
- **Git** – Committing code like a baker commits to the perfect recipe.
- **Postman** – Testing APIs as quickly as I taste-test a fresh batch of cupcakes!
- **Vercel/Heroku** – Deploying apps to the cloud like I'm frosting a towering cake. 🍰
- **Prisma** – Shaping data models with the precision of a cake decorator. 🎂
